# Examples are
# 'Conv-2D', 'Dense" 'BN-1' and 'BN-2'. 'BN-1', 'BN-2' represent two of the multiple different variations of
# the BatchNormalization Op.
# The values are key-value pairs of info related to pattern like required by module identifier:
# 'pattern', 'subgraph', 'op_type', 'module_regex' so on.
# 'pattern' is OpTypePattern and 'subgraph' is the linear sequence of Op for each Op Type.

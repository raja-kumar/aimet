## Requirements
The AIMET package requires the following host platform setup:

- 64-bit Intel x86-compatible processor
- Nvidia GPU card
- Linux Ubuntu: 16.04 LTS or later
- nvidia-docker - Installation instructions: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
- bash command shell

To use the GPU accelerated training modules an Nvidia CUDA enabled GPU with a minimum Nvidia driver version of 361+ is required. Using the latest driver is always recommended, especially if using a newer GPU. Both CUDA and cuDNN (the more advanced CUDA interface) enabled GPUs are supported.

Recommended host system hardware requirements:

- Intel i7 multicore CPU w/hyperthreading
- GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 or Tesla K80
- 16+ GB RAM
- 500GB+ SSD hard drive

While these are not minimum requirements, they are recommended for good performance when training large networks.

## Get the code
To obtain the code, first define a workspace and follow these instructions:

```bash
WORKSPACE="<absolute_path_to_workspace>"
mkdir $WORKSPACE && cd $WORKSPACE
git clone https://github.com/quic/aimet.git
```
Clone the google test repo as follows:
```
cd aimet
mkdir -p ./ThirdParty/googletest
pushd ./ThirdParty/googletest
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b release-1.8.0 googletest-release-1.8.0
popd
```
## Setup the environment
In order to build and run AIMET code, several dependencies are required (such as python, cmake, tensorflow, pytorch, etc). A docker file with all prerequisites and dependencies is available [here](../Jenkins/Dockerfile). Either install the dependencies on your machine using [this Dockerfile](../Jenkins/Dockerfile) as a guide, or just build and launch the docker using the instructions [here](#docker-information).

Set the *common* environment variables as follows:
```bash
source $WORKSPACE/aimet/packaging/envsetup.sh
```

## Build code and install
Follow these instructions to build the AIMET code:

> NOTE: **If you are inside the docker, set `WORKSPACE="<absolute_path_to_workspace>"` again.**
```bash
cd $WORKSPACE 
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ../aimet
make -j8 
```

After a successful build, install the package using the following instructions:
```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/build
make install
```
Once the installation step is complete, the AIMET package is created at `$WORKSPACE/build/staging/universal/lib/`.

## Setup paths
Setup the package and library paths as follows:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$WORKSPACE/build/staging/universal/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$WORKSPACE/build/staging/universal/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$WORKSPACE/build/staging/universal/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$WORKSPACE/build/staging/universal/lib/python:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
At this point, we are all set to use AIMET!

## Usage examples and documentation
The following steps would generate AIMET documentation including the user guide, examples and API documentation at `$WORKSPACE/build/staging/universal/Docs`:

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/build
make doc
```

To begin navigating the documentation, open the page `$WORKSPACE/build/staging/universal/Docs/user_guide/index.html` on any browser.

## Docker information
Code may *optionally* be developed inside a development docker container. This section describes how to build a docker image and launch a container using the provided [Dockerfile](../Jenkins/Dockerfile).

### Build docker image manually
Follow these instructions to build the docker:
```bash
WORKSPACE="<absolute_path_to_workspace>"
docker_image_name="aimet-dev-docker:<any_tag>"
docker_container_name="aimet-dev-<any_name>"
docker build -t ${docker_image_name} -f $WORKSPACE/aimet/Jenkins/Dockerfile .
```

> NOTE: Feel free to modify the `docker_image_name` and `docker_container_name` as needed.

### Start docker container manually
Ensure that a docker named `$docker_container_name` is not already running; otherwise remove the existing container and then start a new container as follows:
```bash
docker ps -a | grep ${docker_container_name} && docker kill ${docker_container_name}

docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
  -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro -v /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
  -v ${HOME}:${HOME} -v ${WORKSPACE}:${WORKSPACE} \
  -v "/local/mnt/workspace":"/local/mnt/workspace" \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash -w ${WORKSPACE} --hostname aimet-dev ${docker_image_name}
```

> **NOTE**
* Feel free to modify the above `docker run` command based on the environment and filesystem on your host machine.
* If nvidia-docker 2.0 is installed, then add `--gpus all` to the `docker run` commands in order to enable GPU access inside the docker container.
* If nvidia-docker 1.0 is installed, then replace `docker run` with `nvidia-docker run` in order to enable GPU access inside the docker container. 

### Build and launch docker using script
The development docker may also be built and launched in interactive mode using the provided script as follows:
```
cd aimet
./buildntest.sh -i
```
If additional directories need to be mounted, use `-m` option with list of targeted directories separated by space **surrounded by double quotes `""`**
```
cd aimet
./buildntest.sh -i -m "sample_dir_1 sample_dir2"
```

To help construct user-specific docker commands, the dry-run option (`-n`) can be used with the above script which prints out the equivalent docker command(s):
```
cd aimet
./buildntest.sh -i -n
# OR
./buildntest.sh -i -n -m "sample_dir_1 sample_dir2"
```
